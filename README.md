# Comment Filter Search

This extension removes any search results that are entirely comment lines. Toggle the behaviour with the `commentFilterSearch.enabled` setting in your user or workspace settings.

When enabled, it replaces the builtâ€‘in file search provider with one that uses VS Code's bundled ripgrep and skips lines detected as comments.
